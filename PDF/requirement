====================== FEEDBACK 1:============================
The feedback so far:
1. PDF scrolling/zooming: good
to-do: if I flip to the next page, it is "small" again.
- we have to have the same size (if user zoomed in) on all other pages.

2. I love the "over-view" gadgets !!
this gave me a good idea of how to present the results from the function "search".
(this is for later milestone, but to keep it in head: It would be fantastic, if we could
show the user this kind of page overview, which shows the pages, where the search
word is in.)

3. I love the possibility to zoom the page to screen-size using the double tap on background.
very nice!

4. and a short design question:
- is it possible to use our own design-bar for the upper bar (where the "Done" and other buttons are in) ?
- I would like to use a bar with a pattern associating to the design on the web-page.
- the main-target are students, so I want to come up with a fresh and fruity design, that stands
out from the "dull-grey - work atmosphere"

5. IMPORTANT:
in both two documents there are zoom-levels, where some lines do not look razor-blade-sharp.
I looked into the goodreader app, and everything is sharp on every zoom-level (but the text has another font).
does this have to do with the font-type ?
please send me the blink-eye pdf as email, so i can check with good reader.

it is not horrible, i can read it still, but it is a little bit irritating and distracting.
(but we can work on that later, if you say it is possible to improve that)

6. just a small thing:
please make the gap between the pages 1/3 the size it is now,
so the pages are closer to each other.

this is it so far.

please implement the word highligting and these few remarks
